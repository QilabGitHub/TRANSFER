## 2. Demo

### Instructions to Run

1. Download the data folder.
2. Open `DataProcessing.ipynb`, update the input and output paths, and run all cells to preprocess the data.
3. Open `Controled_Learning.ipynb`, update the input and output paths, and run the notebook to train and evaluate models.
4. Open `Plots.ipynb`, update the input and output paths, and run the notebook to generate visualizations and final results.

### Expected Output

- Processed datasets saved to the specified output directory.
- Performance metrics displayed in the console and saved as CSV files.
- Visual plots generated and saved in the designated folder.

*Users can modify the file paths in the notebooks to save outputs in their preferred location (e.g., local storage or external cloud services).*

### Expected Run Time

- Data preprocessing: ~2 minutes
- Model training: ~10-30 minutes
- Plot generation: ~1-2 minutes
